## Installation

First, fork the repository to your account.

Then clone the repository to your computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/uzox
```

Install the required packages with NPM (Must have [the Latest NodeJS Version](https://nodejs.org/) installed)

```bash
npm i
```

Open the `config.json` file in the config folder and fill out the fields accordingly.

Once you have filled all the fields including the Lavalink server info you can start the bot and it will work! (If you don't know what that is, read the note below) The bot is presharded :)

```bash
npm start
```

Note: Lavalink servers are JAR files which should be hosted on a server or locally on  your computer to actually play tracks.

To download it go to [this repository](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases) and download the Lavalink.jar file.

You also need to configure the Lavalink server with an application.yml file in the same directory as your JAR. There is a premade one in the resources folder which will work without any issues.
Update the plugin versions regularly by visiting [https://github.com/TopiSenpai/LavaSrc/](https://github.com/TopiSenpai/LavaSrc/releases) and [https://github.com/DuncteBot/skybot-lavalink-plugin/](https://github.com/DuncteBot/skybot-lavalink-plugin/releases) and checking the latest version available.
